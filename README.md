# Stochastic Multi-Timeframe

Stochastic Multi-Timeframe is an MTF indicator for MT4 and MT5 developed by EarnForex.com. It is based on the standard Stochastic Oscillator indicator. It reads the data from Stochastic Oscillator on multiple timferames and displays a single panel on the current chart.

The indicator displays overbought/oversold states, whether the stochastic is rising or failling, and signal/main lines cross. It supports all kinds of alerts.
